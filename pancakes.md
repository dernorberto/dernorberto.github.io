* Outcome: very thick, fluffy delicious ones

### Gluten-free alternative

* Outcome with [Schär Mix-It Universal](https://www.schaer.com/en-int/p/mix-it-universal) = VERY GOOD!
* Outcome with Rewe Glutenfrei Mehl:
  * Reduce the amount of flour to 250g or less;
* DO NOT add any Gum (e.g. Xanthan), they will be a disaster to work with;

* My opinion: too many eggs makes them too firm, but they are insanely good;

### Tips

* If you add berries, make sure they are not frozen or they won't let the batter bake around them and you end up with liquid batter in a baked pancake, yuck!
* Multiply 1,5x to serve a hungry family of 4;

### Ingredients

* 300g flour
* 50g (3tbsp) sugar
* 16g (1 sachet, 4tsp) baking powder
* 6g (1tsp) salt
* 350 ml whole milk (3.5%)
* 1 egg
* 1 tbsp vegetable oil
* (optional: 2,4g baking soda (1/2tsp, de: natriumhydrogencarbonat))

### Directions

1. Combine dry ingredients: flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt;
2. Combine wet ingrediants: eggs, vegetable oil, and whole milk;
3. Combine the two bowls and mix together gently with a rubber spatula. The batter **SHOULD STILL BE LUMPY** with a few dry streaks of flour. Don’t overmix the pancakes!
4. Heat a non-stick griddle or frying pan over medium high heat (level 6-7). Pour, brown on both sides and serve hot.
