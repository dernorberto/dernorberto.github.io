* mix:
  * spinach
  * ricotta (1 pack)
  * Schinken Würfel (bacon bits?) 
  * 2 eggs
* roll in Blätterteig (or other if not available)
* 40 min in the oven and dinner is ready
* note: 
  * Wieners instead of ham is also an acclaimed substitution, add salt to compensate for the lack of bacon

* Roasted veggies are also a success here
* And strangely enough a mixture of 
  * carrots and potatoes, boiled and slightly mashed.
* With a side of Wiener or meat balls of course :face_with_rolling_eyes:
