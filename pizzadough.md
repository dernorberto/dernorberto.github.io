### Tips for cooking at home without a pizza oven (240-300C)

* Pizza steel or ceramic plate required;
* Flour <10% protein will not produce enough gluten to make it stretch
  * On ingredients, make sure that protein > 10g/100g of flour
* Bake on parchment paper, less mess and no flour left burning on the plate;
* I prefer flour to semolina when handling the pie, less grainy crunch when eating;
* Regular ham has a lot of water, Prosciutto Cotto is best;
* Mozarella should be really dry or it will leave a lot of water on the pie;
  * Either use dry mozarella
  * or use regular (or buffalo) mozzarella pressed in a sieve over a bowl overnight;

### Ingredients 65% hidration, 4 pies

* Flour: 330g (Tipo 00 or strong flour, 550)

### Preparation

* Mix dry ingredients

* Let mix a little bit and add some honey (to feed the yeast) and a line of olive oil (for flavor)

  * 8h in a warm place or 24h in a cool place
* 2h before baking, take dough out, split in single balls and put to rest covered; 
* Put 500g of flour into a bowl, this is where the dough ball gets dropped when about to prepare the pie;
