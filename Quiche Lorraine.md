## pastry (Pâte brisée) - make your own (butter-based)

### Gluten-free alternative

* Replaced wheat flour with [Schär Mix-It Universal](https://www.schaer.com/en-int/p/mix-it-universal) = I forgot to add something to make the dough stick (e.g. Xanthan gum) and it came out like flour, fell apart and dried in your mouth. Will try again later.

### Ingredients

* 250g flour
* 125g softened butter (half a pack)
* 1 pinch salt
* ~50 ml water room temp
* (optional: 1 egg yolk)

### Instructions

* flour in a mount and add chunks of softened butter and salt;
* mix butter in with fingers;
* add egg yolk;
* start mixing all the flour while gradually adding water;
* fridge for 30min before preparing (if possible)

### freezer storage

* lay it our flat and make round or rectangular blocs, makes thawing more homogenous;

## pastry - pre-bought (oil-based)

* place the doe with the included parchment paper in the mould
* let the doe stretch a little bit beyond the paper on the border so that it sticks to the mould
