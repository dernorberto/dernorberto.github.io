## Chicken

### Ingredients

* 500g boneless skinless chicken thighs
* 4 tablespoons olive oil
* 2 teaspoons white wine vinegar
* 2 teaspoons chili powder
* 2 teaspoons ancho chili powder
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon onion powder
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
* 1/2 teaspoon coarse ground black pepper
* 2 limes, juiced (about 4 tablespoons)

### Preparation

* Slice chicken breasts into long 1cm thick slices;
* Place in bowl or bag together with marinade refrigerated for 30mins;
* Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the marinated chicken thighs to the skillet and cook 5-7 minutes per side, until fully cooked through. 
* Transfer chicken to cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes;
* Warm up the corn tortillas or tacos on a hot griddle or in the microwave;
* Cut the chicken into bite-sized chunks and serve in warm tortillas with your favorite toppings

## Beef

### Ingredients

* 500g ground beef
* 1 tablespoon chili powder
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1/2 teaspoon onion powder
* 1/2 teaspoon paprika
* 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
* 1 tablespoon cooking oil
* 12 corn tortillas (or more depending on how much you stuff them)

### Preparation

* In a large bowl, add ground beef and all the herbs/spices + mix together with hands until well combined;
* Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. When hot, add the cooking oil. Add the ground beef and break up the meat into smaller chunks using a wooden spoon. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the beef is completely browned, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and discard any excess grease if you’d like. Remove from heat and cover to keep warm.
* Warm the corn tortillas on a hot griddle or skillet, about 30 seconds per each side or until they get some toasty brown spots. Place the tortillas in a tortilla warmer or covered in a warm kitchen towel to keep from getting cold until ready to eat. 

## Toppings

* iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, shredded cheddar cheese, pickled jalapeños, cilantro, limes, hot sauce
