Norberto's family cooking recipes pages

## Intro

It's a rather small and in progress effort to collect simple recipes for busy families.
I was initially collecting recipes in a [github repo](https://github.com/dernorberto/recipesforfamily) with simple .md files. But it then sucked to access them with a browser on a tablet, so I just copied the whole thing to this Github pages.

## Modus Operandi

Open these pages in a web browser on a tablet when preparing to cook, save paper by not printing it out, just make sure to put the tablet in a food splash-free zone.

Fork the repo at will, PR of recipes are very welcome.

## Notes about gluten-free

As I am changing to a gluten-free diet, I'll be adding notes to how well these adapt when replacing mainly wheat-based products.

## Future ideas

* display recipes in a diagram (HTML table) like http://www.cookingforengineers.com/recipe/127/Shepherds-Pie-Cottage-Pie/trn
