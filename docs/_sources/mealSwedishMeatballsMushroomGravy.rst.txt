- a family of 4 = min 500g of mince
- cooking while watching the video is hard unless you are very good with your knife
  and have all the ingredients ready;

Ingredients
#################

For the Meatballs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  1 pound freshly ground pork shoulder
-  Kosher salt
-  ¼ cup buttermilk or heavy cream
-  ¼ ounce (1 packet) unflavored gelatin
-  2 slices high-quality white sandwich bread, crusts removed
-  1 teaspoon soy sauce
-  ½ teaspoon Marmite
-  2 anchovy fillets, mashed to a paste with the back of a fork
-  3 medium cloves garlic, minced or grated on a Microplane (about 1
   tablespoon; reserve about 2 teaspoons for the sauce)
-  1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
-  1 large egg
-  ½ teaspoon ground fennel
-  Freshly ground black pepper
-  2 cups vegetable oil

For the Sauce
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  3 tablespoons unsalted butter
-  8 ounces buttom mushrooms, cleaned and sliced
-  1 small onion, finely diced (about 1 cup)
-  Reserved garlic from above
-  1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
-  1½ cups homemade or low-sodium canned chicken stock
-  1 teaspoon soy sauce
-  ½ cup heavy cream
-  2 teaspoons sugar
-  Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
-  1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
-  1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves

Preparation
#################

#. To make the meatballs: In a large bowl, combine the ground pork with
   the salt. Mix thoroughly with your hands, then set aside at room
   temperature for 30 minutes.

#. Meanwhile, pour the buttermilk into a large bowl and sprinkle the
   gelatin over it. Allow to hydrate for 10 minutes. Add the bread and
   allow to soak for 10 minutes, turning the bread occasionally until
   completely saturated.

#. After the meat has rested, add the soy sauce, Marmite, anchovy paste,
   1 teaspoon of the garlic, the red pepper flakes, egg, sugar, fennel,
   and pepper to taste to the bowl. Add the bread and buttermilk mixture
   and mix gently with your hands until well combined; do not overknead.
   Pull off a teaspoon-sized portion of the mixture, place it on a
   microwave-safe plate, and microwave it on high power until cooked
   through, about 15 seconds. Taste for seasoning, and add more salt and
   pepper to the meat mixture as desired.

#. Using wet hands, form the mixture into meatballs about 1 inch in
   diameter (a generous tablespoon per meatballs—you should get roughly
   30 meatballs), placing them on a large plate as you go.

#. Heat the vegetable oil in a 10-inch nonstick or cast-iron skillet
   over medium-high heat until it reaches 350°F (a meatball should
   sizzle vigorously when you dip the edge of it into the hot oil). Set
   aside 4 meatballs and carefully transfer half of the remaining
   meatballs to the pan. The temperature will drop to around
   300°F—adjust the flame to maintain this temperature (the oil should
   continue to sizzle vigorously but not smoke) and cook until the
   meatballs are well browned on the first side, 1 to 2 minutes.
   Carefully flip them with a small offset spatula or a fork and cook on
   the second side until well browned, about 3 to 4 minutes longer.
   Using tongs, transfer the meatballs to a paper-towel-lined plate.
   Repeat with the remaining meatballs, allowing the oil to return to
   350°F before adding the second batch. Set the meatballs aside
   (discard the oil or strain and save for another use).

#. To make the sauce : Return the skillet to medium-high heat, add 2
   tablespoons of the butter, and heat until the foaming subsides. Add
   the mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until they give up
   their liquid and start to brown, about 8 minutes. Push the mushrooms
   to one side and add the remaining tablespoon of butter to the center
   of the skillet. Add the reserved 4 raw meatballs and mash with a
   wooden spoon, then cook, stirring to break up the meat, until it is
   no longer pink, about 1 minute.

#. Add the onions, stir the meat, mushrooms, and onions together, and
   cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened, about 3
   minutes. Add the remaining garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant,
   about 30 seconds. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 30
   seconds. Slowly pour in the chicken stock, scraping up any browned
   bits from the bottom of the pan. Add the soy sauce, heavy cream, and
   sugar, stir to combine, and bring to a simmer.

#. Add the remaining meatballs to the sauce and cook, stirring and
   turning them occasionally, until they are cooked through and the
   sauce has thickened to the consistency of heavy cream, about 5
   minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste, stir in the lemon
   juice and thyme, and serve.
