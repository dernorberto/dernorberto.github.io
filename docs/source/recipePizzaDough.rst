Tips for cooking at home without a pizza oven (240-300C)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Pizza steel or ceramic plate required;
-  Flour <10% (<10g/100g of flour) protein will not produce enough gluten to make it stretch
-  Bake on parchment paper, less mess and no flour left burning on the plate;
-  I prefer flour to semolina when handling the pie, less grainy crunch when eating;
-  Regular ham has a lot of water, Prosciutto Cotto is best;
-  Mozarella should be really dry or it will leave a lot of water on the pie;
-  Either use dry mozarella or use regular (or buffalo) mozzarella pressed in a sieve over a bowl overnight;
-  Bake in 2 rounds, #1 with only Sauce and #2 with toppings

Ingredients 65% hidration, 4 pies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Flour: 660g (Tipo 00 or strong flour, 550)
-  Water: 432 (luke-warm)
-  Salt: 24g
-  Dry yeast: 4g
-  Honey and olive oil

Preparation
~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Mix dry ingredients
-  Put in mixer and gradually add water
-  Let mix a little bit and add some honey (to feed the yeast) and a
   line of olive oil (for flavor)
-  Put in box/bowl/tray, cover and let rise:

  - 2h on a warm spot (boiler/heater)
  - 8h at room temperature 
  - 24h in a cool place (fridge)

-  2h before baking, take dough out, split in single balls, cover and put to rest;
-  Put 500g of flour into a bowl, when picking balls from tray, dip each side in flour and then lay on table to prepare the pie;
