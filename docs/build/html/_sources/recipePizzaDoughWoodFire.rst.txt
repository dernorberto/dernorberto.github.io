Tips
~~~~

- The more protein, the better for the flour, e.g. Very strong bread flour = 14g.
- Regular ham has a lot of water, Prosciutto Cotto is best.
- Regular fresh mozarella works best for me, buffalo moz only if I need lots of salt.

Prep
~~~~

- Saut√© the mushrooms with salt, pepper, oregano or whatever you like.
- Strip all topings ready to go in bowls.
- Strip the mozarella over a siv inside a bowl and cover.

Tomato sauce
