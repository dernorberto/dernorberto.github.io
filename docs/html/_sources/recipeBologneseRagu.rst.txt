Notes
#################
- Target: a relatively non-frills tom-sauce.
- This is just the sauce, without meat.
- It can then be used for lasagna, with some meat for a spagbol, etc...

Ingredients
#################

- Tomato passata (sieved tomatoes) cans
- Celeri sticks
- Carrots
- Onions
- Salt
- Chicken Stock
- Milk
- Wine
- Olive oil

Preparation
#################

#. Chop and mix: onions + celeri + carrots.
#. Heat up olive oil in a pot and do an 'affogato', until the onions are translucent.
#. Deglaze the veggies with the wine.
#. Once the wine has evaporated, add tomato passata, then chicken stock and a glass of milk.
#. Season with salt and pepper.
#. Let it simmer for at least 2h.
#. Taste check, if it's too bitter, it's ok to add some sugar.
#. Once done, mix in fresh basil leaves.
#. Once cooled down it's ready to be stored in containers.
