Preparation
#################

:Note: If bread is still too soft/fresh, toast the slices in the oven, until light brown;

#. Cut the bread into generous thick slices
#. Wisk the ingredients and drop batter into a flat dish
#. Pre-heat the oven at low temperature to keep them warm
#. Heat up the skillets to low-medium temp, add butter or oil
#. Bathe the slices by turning them over to soak them well
#. Fry in the skillet by turning them 2-4x, until the sides are nice browned
#. Sprinkle some sugar on the sides before their last go
#. Serve with maple syrup
