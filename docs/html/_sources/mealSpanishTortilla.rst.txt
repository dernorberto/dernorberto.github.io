-  The family loved it and my wife was impressed;
-  I should have been more careful with the first side as it burned a
   bit;
-  I used to think it was a lot of work, but it's not;
-  I was making it WHILE watching the video;

Ingredients
#################

-  Potatoes
-  Onions
-  5 eggs
-  Olive oil to cook
-  Salt
-  Pepper

Preparation
################

#. Lightly salt the potatoes slices.
#. Place a large frying pan on high heat and add 2 tbs olive oil. When
   the oil is hot, add the potato slices
#. Turn and separate them over the heat for 5 minutes – try to keep them
   moving enough that they don’t turn brown.
#. Lower the heat and add the onion to the frying pan and place a lid on
   the pan to cover.
#. Move the potato and onion slices around the pan every couple of
   minutes until both are just cooked through.
#. In a mixing bowl, add the eggs and lightly whisk until the whites and
   yolk are just combined. Add salt and pepper.
#. When the potatoes and onions are cooked, add them to the whisked
   eggs. Add the rest of the vegetables (peas and tomato) Heat the
   remaining 1 tbsp of olive oil in the frying pan and allow to come
   back to a high heat.
#. Pour the egg and vegetable mixture into the pan and immediately turn
   the heat down to low.
#. Cook for 15 mins or until there is no liquid egg on the top of the
   omelette.
#. Turn the omelette by flipping onto a dinner plate and then sliding
   the it back into the pan - I find this one very tricky
#. Cook for another 5 mins. Serve in slices.
